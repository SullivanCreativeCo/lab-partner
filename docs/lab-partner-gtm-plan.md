# Lab Partner | Go-to-Market Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Owner:** Keegan (Keegareaux Labs)  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Lab Partner's go-to-market strategy focuses on a tight feedback loop with pilot influencers, validating product-market fit before scaling. We'll launch with 2-3 hand-selected pilots in Week 4, gather intensive feedback, then expand methodically based on what we learn.

**Core GTM Principles:**
- Quality over quantity (start with 2-3 pilots, not 20)
- Learn before scaling (validate before marketing)
- Word-of-mouth first (pilots recruit peers)
- Product-led growth (great product markets itself)

---

## Target Customer Profile

### Ideal Pilot Influencer (Week 4)

**Demographics:**
- Following: 5,000-30,000 (growing, engaged audience)
- Platform: Active on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, or Twitter/X
- Content frequency: Posts 3+ times per week
- Engagement rate: 3%+ (highly engaged community)
- Location: US-based initially (timezone, support)

**Psychographics:**
- Frustrated with platform algorithm changes
- Already thinking about "owning their audience"
- Comfortable with technology (not developer, but tech-savvy)
- Willing to experiment and give feedback
- Has time to invest in community building

**Current pain points:**
- Reach declining on social platforms
- Revenue sharing with Patreon/YouTube cuts into profit
- Followers scattered across multiple platforms
- No direct communication channel
- Limited control over features and experience

**Ideal niches for pilots:**
- Fitness/wellness coaches
- Business/productivity creators
- Gaming streamers
- Educational content creators
- Creative professionals (photography, design, music)

**Red flags (avoid for pilots):**
- >100K followers (too big, too much risk for them)
- <2K followers (too small, hard to validate)
- Inconsistent posting (won't use the platform)
- Purely promotional content (not community-focused)
- Expecting fully polished product (we need patient early adopters)

## Pilot Program Structure

### Phase 1: Recruitment (Week 1-3)

**Goal:** Identify and recruit 2-3 ideal pilot influencers

**Sourcing strategies:**

**1. Personal network (best option)**
- Reach out to influencers you already follow
- Leverage Sullivan Creative Co. client relationships
- Ask ThreatCaptain network for intros
- Tap into Upstate SC creator community

**2. Direct outreach**
- Identify 10-15 potential pilots
- Personalized cold DM on their primary platform
- Mention specific content you've seen (not generic)
- Pitch as "early partner" not "user"

**3. Creator communities**
- Post in creator Discord servers
- Share in subreddits (r/ContentCreators, r/NewTubers)
- Engage in creator Facebook groups
- Attend local creator meetups

**Outreach message template:**

```
Hey [Name],

I've been following your [specific content] and love how you [specific thing they do well].

I'm building Lab Partner - a platform that lets creators like you own your community instead of renting attention from Instagram/YouTube/etc.

Think: Your own branded space where you can live stream, have discussions with your most engaged followers, and eventually monetize without platform fees.

I'm looking for 2-3 creators to be founding partners and help shape the product. You'd get:
- Free access forever (normally paid)
- Direct input on features
- First-mover advantage in your niche
- Your own white-labeled community in ~4 weeks

Interested in a quick call to discuss?

- Keegan

- What's your biggest frustration with current platforms?

- Would you be willing to promote this to your audience?
- Can you commit 2-3 hours/week for the first month?

**Selection criteria:**
- Passes ideal profile checklist
- Genuinely excited about the concept
- Responsive and communicative
- Willing to give honest feedback
- Has time to participate actively

## Marketing Messaging

### Core Positioning

**Primary message:**
"Turn your followers into Lab Partners. Own your community."

**Alternatives:**
- "Your audience. Your platform. Your revenue."
- "Stop renting attention. Own your community."
- "The white-label community platform for creators."

---

### Value Propositions by Audience

**For influencers:**
- Own your audience data
- Keep 100% of revenue
- Direct communication channel
- Professional branded experience
- Never worry about algorithm changes

**For Lab Partners (members):**
- Direct access to creator
- Exclusive content and streams
- Be part of a tight-knit community
- Influence what creator makes
- Recognition for loyalty

---

### Messaging Framework

**Problem:**
You've built an audience, but you don't own the relationship. Platforms control your reach, take your revenue, and scatter your followers across apps.

**Agitation:**
Algorithm changes kill your posts. Patreon takes 20%. Discord is messy. You're one policy change away from losing everything.

**Solution:**
Lab Partner gives you a branded home for your community. Stream exclusively. Have deeper conversations. Monetize directly. All in one place.

**Proof:**
[Pilot] moved 100 followers to Lab Partner and generated $300 in the first week. No platform fees. Full control.
